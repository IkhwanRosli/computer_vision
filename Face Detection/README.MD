# Face Detection
 This is the fundamental knowledge we need to know before we can proceed to face recognition, gender detection or age detection. Usually, people using OpenCV Haar Cascades to do face detection. However, for this code, I'm using the resnet model to received higher accuracy when doing the detection. There are 2 codes in this project which one for doing face detection on images and the other one for real-time detection.
